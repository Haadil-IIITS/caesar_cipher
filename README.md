# caesar_cipher
🔐 Caesar Cipher Tool<br>
A Python implementation of the classic Caesar Cipher, one of the simplest and most widely known<br> encryption techniques. This program allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages by shifting the <br>letters of the alphabet.<br>
<br>
📝 Description<br>
This tool takes a text input and a "shift" number. It then rearranges the letters based on that<br> shift to create a secret code (encryption) or reveal the original message (decryption).<br>
<br>
I built this project to practice:<br>

Python Lists and Indexing.<br>

Modular Arithmetic (using % to wrap around the alphabet).<br>

Functions with parameters.<br>

Control Flow (while loops for continuous user interaction).<br>

⚡ Features<br>
Encryption: Securely hides messages by shifting letters forward.<br>
<br>
Decryption: Reverses the process to reveal the original text.<br>
<br>
Smart Wrapping: Uses the Modulo operator (%) to handle shifts larger than 26 or negative indexes,<br> ensuring the cipher loops back to 'a' after 'z'.
<br><br>
User-Friendly: Accepts lowercase inputs and allows the user to restart the program instantly.<br>
<br>
🎮 How to Use<br>
Run the script in your terminal.<br>
<br>
Type 'encode' to encrypt a message or 'decode' to decrypt one.<br>
<br>
Enter your Message.<br>
<br>
Enter the Shift Number (the key).<br>
<br>
View the result!<br>
